# Research Archive

Historical research and exploration documents from MetaYGN design phases (v0.1.0–v0.9.0).

These files informed architectural decisions but are not active product documentation. They are preserved for design decision traceability.

## Contents

- `searches/` — Multi-model competitive analysis (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok), OPENSAGE integration, RL2F analysis, paper triage
- `master-prompt/` — Pre-plugin master prompts (obsoleted by hooks/skills/agents architecture)
- `chatgpt-Config.md`, `gemini-config.md` — Competitive configuration guides
- `papers-html/` — Raw HTML paper downloads (markdown versions in `docs/papers/md/`)
