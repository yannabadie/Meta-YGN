# Project Brief

## Purpose
Aletheia-Nexus is a local-first metacognitive runtime for AI coding agents. It adds verification, risk classification, safety gates, and context discipline to Claude Code through a thin plugin shell backed by an optional local daemon.

The product wins by detecting when the AI is likely wrong, asking for evidence before risky actions, avoiding unnecessary tool use, and protecting humans from over-trusting AI output.

## Target Users
- **AI-assisted developers** who want Claude Code to be safer and more evidence-driven
- **Teams** who need auditable, proof-carrying AI coding workflows
- **Security-conscious organizations** who require tool-use gating and trust boundary management
- **Plugin developers** looking for a reference implementation of metacognitive patterns

## Competitive positioning
- **vs. Poetiq**: Local-first (privacy + speed) vs. cloud-pure meta-system
- **vs. Superpowers**: Complementary - Superpowers focuses on TDD and workflow; Aletheia focuses on verification, safety, and calibration
- **Unique value**: Proof-carrying answers, factored verification, inverse metacognition (monitoring human fatigue), context pruning
